# Simple Raytracing plugin for blender
I found this to be a very intersting way to see the elements of ray tracing without having to code one

## The plugin uses the code linked below, which is from Stanford's CS148 class
Boiler plate code found from: https://web.stanford.edu/class/cs148/summer23/hws/hw3/hw3.pdf
